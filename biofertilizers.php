                <h4>Nitrogen Biofertilizer (Azotobacter tropicalis)</h4>
                <p>
                    Azotobacter tropicalis is a beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria used in organic farming to enrich soil naturally. It converts atmospheric nitrogen into a form plants can absorb, promoting healthy root growth and improving crop yields without chemical fertilizers. This eco-friendly biofertilizer supports sustainable agriculture and enhances soil fertility over time It also enhances seed germination and strengthens plant resistance to stress conditions.
                    Regular use improves long-term soil health, making it ideal for sustainable organic practices

                <h4> Phosphorus & Zinc Biofertilizer (Bacillus aryabhattai)</h4>
                <p>
                    Bacillus aryabhattai is a phosphate- and zinc-solubilizing bacteria that enhances nutrient availability in organic farming. It converts insoluble phosphorus and zinc in the soil into forms easily absorbed by plants, boosting root development and crop productivity. This biofertilizer reduces dependency on chemical inputs and improves soil health sustainably It also promotes early plant growth and improves flowering and fruiting stages.
                    By enhancing micronutrient uptake, it supports balanced and sustainable crop nutrition

                <h4> Potassium Biofertilizer (Pseudomonas taiwanensis)</h4>
                <p>
                    Pseudomonas taiwanensis is a potassium-solubilizing bacteria that releases bound potassium from soil minerals, making it available to plants. This enhances plant strength, improves disease resistance, and supports better fruit and seed development naturally. It plays a key role in organic farming by reducing chemical potassium fertilizer use and enriching soil health.
                    It aids in water regulation, enzyme activation, and overall plant metabolism.
                    Using this biofertilizer boosts crop quality while maintaining soil sustainability
