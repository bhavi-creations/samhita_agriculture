                <h4>Pseudomonas fluorescens 1% WP</h4>
                <p>
                    Pseudomonas fluorescens 1% WP is a powerful biological control agent widely used in Bio-organic and sustainable agriculture. It acts as a bio-fungicide by suppressing harmful soil-borne pathogens through competitive colonization and production of anti-fungal compounds. This eco-friendly formulation promotes plant health, enhances root development, and increases resistance to diseases like wilt, damping-off, and root rot By improving nutrient uptake and stimulating plant immunity, Pseudomonas fluorescens contributes to stronger crops, higher yields, and reduced dependency on chemical fungicides. It is safe for the environment
